daeD
====

A library for loading collada files with the D programming language (huzzah!).

I created this library because I feel that libraries like assimp, while great
are just too big for what I personally need. I want to use one format for my 3d
assets, and I want the format to be an open standard - so Collada it is!

Check the LICENSE.txt file bundled with this source distribution for terms of use. SPOILER:
It's zlib.

Remember, assimp is grown - daeD is designed :)

Enjoy this library!
